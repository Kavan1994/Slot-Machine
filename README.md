# Slot-Machine
C++ Computer Programming Project
Slot Machine Project I made for my class -> Introduction to Computer Science
======================================================================

This project was another simple project I created for my school. This was created before I learned about functions, which would have made the project much easier to code. The code is very simple, just using a do loop with some conditionals. 

The application has limited functionality. The game is ran through a console screen, and the only way to play is by typing "Y" or "y" into the console. If the three "slots" are the same number, the user receives coins.

The amount of coins earned are as followed:
3 3's = 100 coins rewarded
3 2's = 50 coins rewarded
3 1's = 20 coins rewarded
