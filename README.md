# Slot-Machine
High School project coded in C++

This was a simple project I created for my school. The code is very simple, using a simple loop with one main function.

The application has limited functionality. The game is ran through a console screen, and the only way to play is by typing "Y" or "y" into the console. If the three "slots" are the same number, the user receives coins.

The amount of coins earned are as followed:
3 3's = 100 coins rewarded
3 2's = 50 coins rewarded
3 1's = 20 coins rewarded
